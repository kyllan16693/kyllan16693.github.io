This project can not be seen locally unless you start a server (I suggest a python server)

- To run it "locally" you can use a python server that comes with python. By opening a terminal and navigating to 
    the folder where this file is located and then type: python3 -m http.server
- Then open a browser and go to http://localhost:8000
