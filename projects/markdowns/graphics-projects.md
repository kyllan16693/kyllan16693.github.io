# Graphics Projects
#### Fall 2022

I have finished taking a graphics class, and these are my projects from the semester. Some are 
- <a href="../../projects/graphicsProjects/project1/project1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Brick Breaker Game</a> - Bounce the ball to remove the bricks
    - This was the first project, and it just meant to be an introduction to the class and drawing shapes
- <a href="../../projects/graphicsProjects/project2/project2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotating Stars</a> - Stars rotate around the center
    - This was the second project, and it was meant to be an introduction to transformations and movement
- <a href="../../projects/graphicsProjects/project3/project3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bouncing Stars</a> - Stars bounce around the screen
    - This was the third project, and it was meant to be an introduction to <a href="https://glmatrix.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> glMatrix </a> and more complex movement
- <a href="../../projects/graphicsProjects/project5/project5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Platonic Solids</a> - Interactively explaining the platonic solids
    - This is my favorite project, and it was meant to be an introduction to 3D shapes, more complex transformations, having multiple view ports, and user interaction
- <a href="../../projects/graphicsProjects/project8/project8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Reflective Environment</a> - Multiple Skybox environments
    - This was the final project, and is meant to be an introduction to 3D environments, reflections, and skyboxes
