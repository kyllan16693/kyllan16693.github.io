# MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>
#### Febuary 2023

With a spare Raspberry Pi I had laying around I breathed new life into an old broken monitor with <a href="https://magicmirror.builders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MagicMirror<sup>2</sup></a>. The setup was super easy with the well detailed inscructions on the website and git repo. The monitor I used had some verticle black lines but with the monitor on its side I was able to hide them by not putting any elements in that area. This monitor also has built in USB ports so I am able to power the pi from the monitor, so the whole thing only needs one power cable. I currently have the base packages installed (Time and Date, Calendar, Weather, News Feed, and Compliments), along with a Canvas element that shows upcoming assignments from my school's Canvas website. I also have a custom module that shows the a picture of a QR code that I generated to automatically connect to my home wifi<a href="https://qifi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> (made here)</a>. I also have a ping tool installed which pings google, cloudflare, and my NAS to check the status. Current modules I am using:
