## Website redesign
#### March 2024

Since I first made my website I haven't changed it much so over spring break I wanted to redesign it. I wanted to make it more modern and add some features that I have wanted to add for a while. I redid the color scheme and redesigned almost every page. Check it out and see if you can find all the hidden features!


## Website Update and Graduation
#### May 2023

Since I have graduated from the University of Wisconsin Madison and they can no longer host my website, I got my domain name <a href="https://kyllan.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kyllan.dev</a>. My webiste is being hosted by github at <a href="kyllan16693.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kyllan16693.github.io</a> but is being forwarded to <a href="https://kyllan.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kyllan.dev</a>. I learned a lot while doing this, mostly about DNS forwarding, at least more than I learned in my networks class in my undergrad. I was also able to set up a new email address with my domain name. Contact me at <a href="mailto:sayhi@kyllan.dev">sayhi@kyllan.dev</a>


## Website Created
#### July 2022

I created this website to show off my skills as a well-rounded programmer and a place to show off my projects. This website was developed without a framework and independently. I am self-taught in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and plan on expanding this website as I learn more. To see more about this project inspect elements or view the GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/kyllan16693/PersonalWebsite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

This website is currently hosted by the University of Wisconsin Madison:<a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UW Madison hosting directory</a>
