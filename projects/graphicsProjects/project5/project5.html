    <h3>Regular Polygons </h3>
    <p>In Euclidean geometry, a regular polygon is a polygon that is direct equiangular (all angles are equal in measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length). Regular polygons may be either convex, star or skew. In the limit, a sequence of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides approximates a circle, if the perimeter or area is fixed, or a regular apeirogon (effectively a straight line), if the edge length is fixed. See more here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon</a> </p>

    <input id="twodSlider" type="range" min="3" max="12" /> Slide to increase the number of edges. The smallest shape we can make is a triangle (as a 2 sided shape does not exist)

    <p>Now what happens when we take theses 2d regular polygons and make 3d shapes out of them. These results shapes are know as platonic solids</p>
    <h3>Platonic solids</h3>
    <p>In geometry, a Platonic solid is a convex, regular polyhedron in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Being a regular polyhedron means that the faces are congruent (identical in shape and size) regular polygons (all angles congruent and all edges congruent), and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. There are only five such polyhedra:</p>
